In this folder is an unediting dump of the knowledge-base formerly hosted at https://help.haikuforteams.com/

Some of these articles remain relevant for the open-source Haiku Animator, while some refer to the former paid commercial service.

These could be made more accessible by hosting them on a statically accessible website and by pruning out some the commercial-specific information, but that was out of scope for the initial open-sourcing effort.  Instead, the raw data is available here for posterity.
