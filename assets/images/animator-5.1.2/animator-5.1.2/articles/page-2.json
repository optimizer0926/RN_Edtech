      "body": "<p class=\"intercom-align-left\">Especially if you're using any of Animator's interactivity features, it's worth thinking about what you're building as \"software\" rather than a design.  I.e. even though the interface feels like a design tool, what you're creating is a production UI.</p>\n<p class=\"intercom-align-left\">As part of that mindset, there's really no silver bullet for what limits to respect, etc. — just as you can write non-performant code in Swift, you can create a non-performant UI animation in Animator.  The best way to figure it out is to iterate, get it on a device, and iterate again.</p>\n<p class=\"intercom-align-left\">Re: iOS specifically, have you tried out the Lottie export functionality?  You'll find that it's generally more performant on iOS &amp; Android because it uses native-based renderers instead of web renderers.  Just note that Lottie doesn't support any interactions, and <a href=\"https://help.haikuforteams.com/en/articles/2273793-troubleshooting-lottie\" target=\"_blank\">there are a handful of other features that won't translate 100%</a>.  It all comes back to iteration &amp; experimentation.</p>\n<p class=\"intercom-align-left\">Finally, if what you're delivering is a prototype or explanation aid instead of slated-for-production UI, you may find some success in exporting an mp4, which should render performantly on just about any device.</p>",
