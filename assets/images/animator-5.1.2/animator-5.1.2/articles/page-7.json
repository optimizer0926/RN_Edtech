How is it different from other apps?","body":"<p class=\"intercom-align-left\">Animator is a motion design app for creating production-ready animations and UI components. </p>\n<p class=\"intercom-align-left\">We're focused on: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Design expressiveness (e.g. the timeline, plus the ability to respond to user input and live data) and </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Connected workflows with developers. </p>\n</li>\n</ol><p class=\"intercom-align-left\">We think being able to create live, usable <b>animations and</b> <b>UI components</b> trumps being able to just make pictures of them. We think developer hand off is a huge problem, not a feature. That is what sets us apart from other design tools. Some of them let you <i>prototype</i> using their screen interactions, others are great for making videos or Hollywood special effects, but it’s ultimately still a mockup that can’t be integrated with your codebase— a developer still has to re-create any designers work by hand.</p>\n<p class=\"intercom-align-left\"><br>The most <b>fundamental</b> difference between Animator and those tools is that they’re built around the ‘hand off’ paradigm. With those you’re handing off specs, interactive mockups or generated code to a developer who then integrates it with your codebase. Some of those tools even advertise hand off as a feature, but we think it’s actually part of the problem.</p>\n<p class=\"intercom-align-left\">With Animator:</p>\n<ul><li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Everything is production ready, so you don’t waste time creating throwaway prototypes, as a designer you can author the actual animations and UI components that’ll be used by your website or app.</p>\n</li></ul><ul><li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">It’s always-integrated, so you can iterate on your designs even after they’ve been integrated with a codebase.</p>\n</li></ul><p class=\"intercom-align-left\">The best example of that is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYRd-TU3URk\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. There’s an animation authored in Animator, embedded in a web app, and iOS &amp; Android emulators, and you can see even changes made in the Sketch source file being pushed all the way through to the embedded animation in the apps. Unlimited iteration, without needing to constantly ‘hand off’ to a developer or, without a developer needing to re-create your work. </p>\n<p class=\"intercom-align-left\"><br>It really comes down to how closely you want to collaborate:  if a designer is comfortable with \"this is my silo; I will hand off this video [or export it to Lottie] and the rest is up to the developer\" then Animator probably isn't for them. <br><br>If a designer is interested in <i>collaborating</i> with the developer to build the animation or UI together, this is what Animator <a href=\"https://www.haiku.ai/blog/introducing-haiku\" target=\"_blank\">is all about</a>.  Every action in Animator is backed by a line of code.  Every visual change is automatically handled with a git commit.  When the designer pushes <code>publish</code>, they're doing a <code>git push</code>, and their work is published to <code>npm</code> (these are all literal, not figurative).  Importantly, once the designer's work is part of the UI, they can <i>keep on changing</i> it, iterating, experimenting — because it's connected to the developer through code &amp; version control.</p>\n<p class=\"intercom-align-left\">That's why Animator doesn't export measurements and styles, it doesn't “generate code” that you can never touch, and it doesn't lock up your motion design inside arcane object files. At Haiku, we like to say that our design format <i>is code. </i>The format happens to be open source.<i> </i>And although it may not feel like it, every time you edit a project in Animator, you're really <i>editing code</i>. But instead of literally typing instructions into a text file, you're doing so by dragging elements, tweaking numbers with your arrow keys, and pressing 'Play' instead of using the command line.</p>","author_id":1435175,"state":"published","created_at":1533753698,"updated_at":1618932817,"url":"http://help.haikuforteams.com/en/articles/2218082-what-is-animator-for","parent_id":705196,"parent_type":"collection"},{"id":"2218072","type":"article","workspace_id":"xlfy6shk","title":"How to expand the timeline","description":"Do you need to see more frames in the timeline?

To do so, simply click on the [+] button at the top of the library panel. </p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">You can also create a brand new file by clicking the [Sketch] button under \"Library\".<br></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/79562530/4603f823c12a11a7e90f3f19/Screen+Shot+2018-10-05+at+16.39.22.png\"></div><p class=\"no-margin\">Behind the scenes, we convert all your Sketch design's artboards, pages, and slices into individual assets that may be independently composed and animated on stage.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">To get an asset on stage, just drag and drop it!</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"dragging-and-dropping-items-on-stage\">DRAGGING AND DROPPING ITEMS ON STAGE</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">This one's self-explanatory: to get an item from the Library to the Stage, simply drag and drop. The new element will show up on the stage where you drop it, and a new row will show up in the Timeline representing the new element.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<h2 id=\"changing-assets-from-sketch\">CHANGING ASSETS FROM SKETCH</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">What if you need to make a change to the Sketch file? That's fine! We'll take care of bringing your new changes into Animator and onto any assets you've placed on the stage.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">When you import a Sketch file, we automatically make a copy of that file and start tracking changes behind the scenes with Git. <i>What this means is if you make changes to your original file, they won't show up by default in Animator.</i></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"><b>To make changes to your Sketch-linked assets, double-click the Sketch file in the library.</b> Sketch will launch, and when you <b>Save</b> in Sketch, changes will automatically be tracked in Animator. Even elements already on the stage remain linked and can be updated directly from Sketch.</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<div class=\"intercom-container\"><img src=\"https://downloads.intercomcdn.com/i/o/71171903/781a8ba8f707b715c3cd0de5/open-sketch.gif\"></div><h2 id=\"troubleshooting\">TROUBLESHOOTING</h2>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you're having trouble getting your Sketch assets into Animator, check the following:</p>\n<p class=\"no-margin\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Ensure that Haiku.app is installed in your /Applications folder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Ensure that Sketch is also installed in your /Applications folder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Ensure that you've marked your Sketch assets for export, OR sliced them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">Ensure that you've saved your Sketch file after slicing/marking for export.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p class=\"no-margin\">If you imported a pre-existing Sketch file, note that Animator makes a <b>copy</b> of the Sketch file that you import.  If you make changes to the original file, Animator will not automatically copy those changes over to the new file.  As a result, after importing a file, we recommend closing the original Sketch file and opening the copy through Animator by double-clicking it in the Library.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>","author_id":2225436,"state":"published","created_at":1522887899,"updated_at":1618932818,"url":"http://help.haikuforteams.com/en/articles/1765923-importing-designs-from-sketch","parent_id":1466578,"parent_type":"collection"}]}
