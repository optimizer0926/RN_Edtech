With this demo we need to verify that when you click the cards, the needle moves to
 the center of the gauge. There is a bug where it seems like the state of other components
 on the stage seems to get involved, and the needle moves to where the previous gauge was
 first. Quickest way to repro is to click the second element, then click the first.
