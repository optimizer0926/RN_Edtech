In the DOM and ReactDOM examples, time should be controlled, simulating what happens when the user manually changes the scrubber position inside Haiku.app. Time in Main should start at 0ms and advance by 16.666ms on a 100ms interval, which should also lock all guest components to 0. All components should remain in the same position. And the background should gradually become a lighter gray.
